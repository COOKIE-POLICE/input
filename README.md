## üì¶ Input Library for Roblox

**Author:** bennyuiuy

GODOTTT!!!!! As a Godot developer that migrated to Roblox very recently, I created this library to handle inputs in Roblox in a Godot-like fashion because my tiny brain cannot handle inputs in a Robloxian way.

## ‚ú® Why Use This Over `UserInputService`?

You might be asking. Why would anyone use this over the original Roblox UserInputService?
Well, in my totally and absolutely unbiased opinion this library, module or whatever you wanna call it, is way easier to use.
1. It is very Godot-like, do I need to say more?
2. It allows you to detect Input Actions easily (Roblox Beta Feature).
3. It correctly gets the physical mouse delta. In my tests, I saw that the built-in mouse delta only changes when camera moves.
4. It allows a easier way to get device rotation, acceleration and gravity.
5. It is a easier way to get mouse scroll delta.

## üìñ How to Use

### üìÇ Setup

Place your `InputContext`, `InputAction`, and `InputBinding` instances inside this module script.

**Example Structure:**

```
InputModule
 ‚îú‚îÄ InputContext (instance of InputContext)
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ MoveLeft (InputAction)
 ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ KeyboardBinding (InputBinding)
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ MoveRight (InputAction)
 ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ KeyboardBinding (InputBinding)
 ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ Jump (InputAction)
 ‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ KeyboardBinding (InputBinding)
```

---

## üì¶ Loading the Module

```lua
local Input = require(path.to.InputModule)
```

---

## üî® Basic Usage

### Check if an action is continuously pressed:

```lua
if Input.IsActionPressed("Jump") then
	print("Jumping!")
end
```

### Check for a one-time press:

```lua
if Input.IsActionJustPressed("Fire") then
	print("Fire button was just pressed")
end
```

### Check for a one-time release:

```lua
if Input.IsActionJustReleased("Fire") then
	print("Fire button was just released")
end
```

## üìä Axis and Vector Inputs

Use for movement or directional input:

```lua
local moveX = Input.GetAxis("MoveLeft", "MoveRight")
local moveY = Input.GetAxis("MoveDown", "MoveUp")

local moveVector = Input.GetVector("MoveLeft", "MoveRight", "MoveDown", "MoveUp")
```

---

## üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Input

```lua
local mousePos = Input.GetMousePosition()
local mouseDelta = Input.GetMouseDelta()
local scrollDelta = Input.GetMouseWheelDelta()
```

---

## üì± Device Data

```lua
local acceleration = Input.GetDeviceAcceleration()
local gravity = Input.GetDeviceGravity()
local rotation = Input.GetDeviceRotation()
```

---

## üîÑ Rebinding Actions

```lua
Input.RebindAction("Jump", "KeyboardBinding", Enum.KeyCode.Space)
```

---

## üì° Check if Any Input is Pressed

```lua
if Input.IsAnyPressed() then
	print("Some input is being held down")
end
```

## üìä Input Method Chart

| Method                               | Description                                                              | Returns   | Use Case                                            |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `IsActionPressed(name)`              | Checks if an InputAction is currently held.                              | `bool`    | Detecting if a specific action is being held.       |
| `IsActionJustPressed(name)`          | Checks if an InputAction was pressed this frame.                         | `bool`    | Trigger something once when pressed.                |
| `IsActionJustReleased(name)`         | Checks if an InputAction was released this frame.                        | `bool`    | Trigger something once when released.               |
| `IsAnyPressed()`                     | Checks if **any input** is being pressed (actions, keys, mouse buttons). | `bool`    | Detect when *anything* is currently pressed.        |
| `GetAxis(negAction, posAction)`      | Returns `-1`, `0`, or `1` based on negative/positive action states.      | `number`  | Simplified directional input (horizontal/vertical). |
| `GetVector(negX, posX, negY, posY)`  | Returns a `Vector2` from pairs of directional actions.                   | `Vector2` | Movement or aiming input.                           |
| `GetMousePosition()`                 | Current mouse position on screen.                                        | `Vector2` | For UIs or custom mouse systems.                    |
| `GetMouseDelta()`                    | Mouse movement delta since last frame.                                   | `Vector2` | For look or aim control.                            |
| `GetMouseWheelDelta()`               | Scroll wheel delta (resets each frame).                                  | `number`  | Scroll actions or zoom systems.                     |

| `IsMouseButtonPressed(Button)`       | Check if a mouse button is pressed.                                      | `bool`    | For direct mouse input checks.                      |
| `GetDeviceAcceleration()`            | Returns current device acceleration vector.                              | `Vector3` | For mobile tilting controls.                        |
